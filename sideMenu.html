                <p class="title">Our History</h2>
                <p class="text"> The history of our children's hospital is steeped in dedication and effort, dating back several decades. It all began when there was a pressing need in our community for a place where children could receive proper medical care. People came together to establish the hospital, starting with modest facilities that grew steadily with support from local donations and volunteer medical professionals.</p>
                    
                <p class="text">In the post-war era, the hospital played a crucial role in treating children injured by the war, further highlighting its importance. By the 1960s, it had become recognized as one of the most advanced medical facilities in the region. Over the years, the hospital has continually upgraded its equipment and facilities, leveraging advancements in medical technology and the expertise of its healthcare staff to provide the best possible care for children.</p>
                    
                <p class="text">Today, our hospital is trusted not only within the community but also across the country, attracting patients from far and wide seeking to restore their children's health. Yet, behind its success lies the steadfast support of the community and the dedicated efforts of our medical staff. Moving forward, our hospital remains committed to putting children's health first and continuing its path of growth and innovation.</p>
